# cs50 Finance web app solution 

This is my solution for the final problem for Harvard’s CS50 course. It is shared under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license. 

Attribution goes to Harvard’s CS50 course. 

Obviously if you are doing the course please consider carefully before reading/using this solution, it will be much more beneficial to complete your own solution. 

I have added this repository to my GitHub to illustrate the skills learnt in the course: 

* The use of Flask to generate interactive webpages
* The use of SQLite 
* The parsing of JSON
